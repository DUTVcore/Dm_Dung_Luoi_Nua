> **"Stop Simping. Start Coding. Get Hired."**

## 📖 Introduction

**Focus Tab** (Codename: *Dm_Dung_Luoi_Nua*) is a Chrome Extension designed to replace the boring default "New Tab" page.

This project was born from a personal necessity: I needed a minimalist workspace to eliminate distractions from Social Media/Short Videos and maximize focus on my main goal: **Getting hired by my Junior year**.

It transforms your browser into a true "cockpit"—complete with schedules, goals, and inspiring dynamic backgrounds to keep your momentum going.

## ✨ Features

* **⚡ Lightweight Core:** Written in **Vanilla JS**. No heavy frameworks involved. RAM usage is optimized to run smoothly even on 4GB RAM systems (just like Chrome intended).
* **🎯 Goal Reminder:** Keeps your most important goal front and center. Never forget what you are grinding for.
* **📅 Future-Ready Task Manager:**
    * **Plan Ahead:** Supports adding tasks for specific dates in the future.
    * **Schedule Forwarding:** Manage your workload days in advance so you never get hit by a surprise deadline.
* **⏰ Precision Timing (Optional):**
    * **Time Management Module:** Assign specific time slots to your tasks.
    * **Toggle Mode:** Fully customizable. Switch to "Hardcore Mode" for minute-by-minute discipline, or turn it off for a cleaner, stress-free interface.
* **🎨 Deep Customization:** Extended UI control (Fonts, UI Scaling, Opacity, etc.). Make the dashboard fit your personal aesthetic.
* **🎬 Dynamic Background:**
    * Supports static images (JPG/PNG).
    * **Live Wallpaper Support (MP4/WebM):** Use video backgrounds (e.g., *Toothless Dancing*, *Cyberpunk City*, *Lofi Hip Hop*) for maximum vibes.
* **📝 Fast Todo-list:** Tasks are persisted via `LocalStorage`. Your data remains safe even after closing the browser.
* **⚙️ Quick Settings:** A sleek, Glassmorphism-style modal for instant configuration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, Backdrop-filter).
* **Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Storage:** Chrome LocalStorage API.
